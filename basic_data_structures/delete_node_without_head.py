"""
Problem
Given the head of a linked list and a position, delete the node at that position without having direct access to the previous node. You must delete the node by only accessing the node itself.

This problem simulates a scenario where you're given a pointer to a node in the middle of a linked list and asked to delete it without access to the head or previous nodes.

Input:

head: the head node of a singly linked list
position: an integer representing the position of the node to delete (1-indexed)
Output:

Return the head of the modified linked list
Constraints:

The list has at least 2 nodes
The node to delete is not the last node
Position is valid (1 <= position < length of list)
Examples:

Example 1:

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4], position = 2
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation: Delete node at position 2 (value 2)
Example 2:

Input: head = [4, 5, 1, 9], position = 3
Output: [4, 5, 9]
Explanation: Delete node at position 3 (value 1)
